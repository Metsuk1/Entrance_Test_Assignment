# Caesar Cipher & Arithmetic Expression Evaluator          
            
This Java project implements two core functionalities:            
            
1. **Caesar Cipher** — Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar cipher algorithm, supporting both English and Russian (Cyrillic) alphabets, including the special Russian letter `Ё/ё`.            
2. **Arithmetic Expression Evaluator** — Parses and evaluates mathematical expressions following standard operator precedence (PEMDAS/BODMAS), with support for nested parentheses and decimal numbers.            
How to Run
